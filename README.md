## Overview

The Bike Store E-Commerce project is a full-stack application designed for bike enthusiasts. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and styled with Tailwind CSS, this application allows users to browse, select, and purchase bikes seamlessly. The platform offers a user-friendly experience with robust features for both customers and administrators.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login processes for managing user accounts.
- **Product Browsing**: Users can explore a variety of bikes, complete with detailed descriptions and high-quality images.
- **Shopping Cart**: Users can easily add bikes to their cart, adjust quantities, and view the total price before checkout.
- **Order Management**: Users can view their order history and details.
- **Admin Dashboard**: A dedicated interface for administrators to manage products, including adding, editing, and removing bike listings.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout optimized for both mobile and desktop devices, leveraging Tailwind CSS for styling.
- **Search and Filter**: Users can search for bikes by name and filter results based on categories and price.
- **Payment Integration**: Supports payment processing (e.g., with Stripe or PayPal) for a smooth checkout experience.
